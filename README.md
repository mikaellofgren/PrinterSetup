# PrinterSetup<br>

A simple printer utility that generates lpadmin output to add printers.<br>
It also generates lpadmin options from the PPD file.<br>
And tries to find the ip number of a bonjour (dnssd) printer (you need to be on the same network as the printer)<br>
Export output as no payload pkg and munki pkg info.<br>
From the preferences settings you can choose to generate a signed pkg and enable Cups Webinterface.<br>
<br>

You can also use it to export any bashscript by simply paste your bashscript to the Final settings field<br>
and give the output a name in the Cups print queue name field and then choose the export options.<br>
